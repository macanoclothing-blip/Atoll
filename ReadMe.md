Atoll turns the MacBook notch into a focused command surface for media, system insight, and quick utilities. It stays out of the way until needed, then expands with responsive, native SwiftUI animations.

</p>



## Highlights
- Media controls for Apple Music, Spotify, and more with inline previews.
- Live Activities for media playback, Focus, screen recording, privacy indicators, downloads (beta), and battery/charging.
- Lock screen widgets for media, timers, charging, Bluetooth devices, and weather.
- Lightweight system insight for CPU, GPU, memory, network, and disk usage.
- Productivity tools including timers, clipboard history, color picker, and calendar previews.
- Customization for layouts, animations, hover behavior, and shortcut remapping.

## Other Features
- Gesture controls for opening/closing the notch and media navigation.
- Parallax hover interactions with smooth transitions.
- Lock screen appearance and positioning controls for panels and widgets.

## Requirements
- macOS 14.0 or later (optimised for macOS 15+).
- MacBook with a notch (14/16‑inch MBP across Apple silicon generations).
- Xcode 15+ to build from source.
- Permissions as needed: Accessibility, Camera, Calendar, Screen Recording, Music.

## Installation
1) Download the latest DMG: https://github.com/Ebullioscopic/Atoll/releases/download/v1.3.0-beta/Atoll.1.3.0-beta.dmg
2) Open the DMG and drag Atoll into Applications.
3) Launch Atoll and grant the requested permissions.

## Quick Start
- Hover near the notch to expand; click to enter controls.
- Use tabs for Media, Stats, Timers, Clipboard, and more.
- Adjust layout, appearance, and shortcuts from Settings.

## Settings
- Choose appearance, animation style, and per‑feature toggles.
- Remap global shortcuts and adjust hover behaviour.
- Enable lock screen widgets and select data sources.

## Gesture Controls
- Two-finger swipe down to open the notch when hover-to-open is disabled; swipe up to close.
- Enable horizontal media gestures in **Settings → General → Gesture control** to turn the music pane into a trackpad for previous/next or ±10 second seeks.
- Pick the gesture skip behaviour (track vs ±10s) independently from the skip button configuration so swipes can scrub while buttons change tracks—or vice versa.
- Horizontal swipes trigger the same haptics and button animations you see in the notch, keeping visual feedback consistent with tap interactions.

## Troubleshooting (Basics)
- After granting Accessibility or Screen Recording, quit and relaunch the app.
- If metrics are empty, enable categories in Settings → Stats.
- Media not responding: verify player is active and Music permission is granted.

## Acknowledgments

Atoll builds upon the work of several open-source projects and draws inspiration from innovative macOS applications:

- [**Boring.Notch**](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch) - foundational codebase that provided the initial media player integration, AirDrop surface implementation, file dock functionality, and calendar event display. Major architectural patterns and notch interaction models were adapted from this project.

- [**Alcove**](https://tryalcove.com) - primary inspiration for the Minimalistic Mode interface design and the conceptual framework for lock screen widget integration that informed Atoll's compact layout strategy.

- [**Stats**](https://github.com/exelban/stats) - source implementation for CPU temperature monitoring via SMC (System Management Controller) access, frequency sampling through IOReport bindings, and per-core CPU utilisation tracking. The system metrics collection architecture derives from Stats project readers.

- [**Open Meteo**](https://open-meteo.com) - weather apis for the lock screen widgets

- [**SkyLightWindow**](https://github.com/Lakr233/SkyLightWindow) - window rendering for Lock Screen Widgets

- Wick - Thanks Nate for allowing us to replicate the iOS like Timer design for the Lock Screen Widget

## Updating Existing Clones
If you previously cloned DynamicIsland, update the remote to track the Atoll repository:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Ebullioscopic/Atoll.git
```

A heartfelt thanks to [TheBoredTeam](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam) for being supportive and being totally awesome, Atoll would not have been possible without Boring.Notch
